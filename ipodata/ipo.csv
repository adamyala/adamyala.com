Company Description,"Zendesk believes the fundamental relationship between organizations and their
customers is changing, and a new customer service philosophy is emerging.

Zendesk was formed to help organizations capitalize on this profound shift. We
are a software development company that provides a> software-as-a-service, or
SaaS, customer service platform. Our beautifully simple platform helps
organizations engage with people in new ways that foster long-term customer
loyalty and satisfaction. We empower organizations to better answer customers’
questions, and to solve their problems through the channels that people use
every day when seeking help, such as email, chat, voice, social media, and
websites. Our platform also helps people find answers on their own through
knowledge bases and communities, capitalizing on the increasing customer
preference for self-service. Our customer engagement capabilities allow
organizations to proactively serve their customers, reaching out to those who
may need help and soliciting feedback about their experience. The openness of
our customer service platform makes it easy for organizations to integrate with
their other applications. Our platform consolidates the data from customer
interactions and provides organizations with powerful analytics and performance
benchmarking.

Our business model is designed to drive organic growth, leverage positive
word-of-mouth, and remove friction from the evaluation and purchasing process.
The majority of our customers find us online and subscribe to our customer
service platform directly from our website. Exemplifying the success of our
sales and marketing strategy, during the quarter ended December 31, 2013, 70% of
our qualified sales leads, which are largely comprised of prospects that
commence a free trial of our customer service platform, came from organic
search, customer referrals, and other unpaid sources. For larger organizations,
our sales team focuses on a land and expand strategy, which leverages this
grassroots adoption and seeks to expand our footprint within organizations.

We currently have more than 40,000 customer accounts on our customer service
platform, which represent organizations across a broad array of sizes,
industries, and geographies. Our customers are located in over 140 countries and
provide customer service through our platform in over 40 languages.

In March 2014, we completed the acquisition of Zopim Technologies Pte Ltd., or
Zopim, a software development company that provides a SaaS live chat service.
Through Zopim, we provide live chat software as a standalone service and as an
integrated service with our customer service platform for chat-enabled agents.

Our financial performance reflects our significant customer growth and strong
customer retention and expansion. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2013, our total revenue was $38.2 million and $72.0 million, respectively,
representing approximately 88% growth from 2012 to 2013. For the years ended 
December 31, 2012 and 2013, we derived $15.8 million, or 41%, and $29.6 million, 
or 41%, of our revenue from customers located outside of the United States, 
respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, we also generated 
net losses of $24.4 million and $22.6 million, respectively. We intend to
invest aggressively to drive continued growth and market leadership.

Company Description,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of a portfolio of product candidates to treat patients
suffering from central nervous system, or CNS, diseases. Leveraging our domain
expertise, we have acquired or in-licensed four development-stage> proprietary
compounds that we believe have innovative mechanisms of action with potentially
positive therapeutic profiles. Our lead product candidates are MIN-101, a
compound we are developing for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, and
MIN-117, a compound we are developing for the treatment of patients suffering
from major depressive disorder, or MDD. In addition, our portfolio includes
MIN-202, a compound we are co-developing for the treatment of patients suffering
from primary and secondary insomnia, and MIN-301, a compound we are developing
for the treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. We believe our
innovative product candidates have significant potential to transform the lives
of a large number of affected patients and their families who are currently not
well-served by available therapies in each of their respective indications.

We plan to develop and, if approved by the applicable regulatory authorities,
commercialize our product candidates for the neuropsychiatric pharmaceutical
market, which represents a significant portion of the broader CNS therapeutic
area. Neuropsychiatry is a medical subspecialty devoted to understanding and
treating cognitive, emotional, behavioral and perceptual symptoms resulting from
circuit-specific brain dysfunction and includes the study of the diseases we are
presently targeting, namely schizophrenia, MDD, insomnia and Parkinson's
disease. These neuropsychiatric diseases affect large numbers of individuals
with family members also bearing significant burdens. According to Datamonitor,
an independent market research firm, 4.7 million people suffer from
schizophrenia, 32 million suffer from MDD, 53 million suffer from insomnia and
more than 2.4 million suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States,
Japan and the five major European Union markets of France, Germany, Italy, Spain
and the United Kingdom.

While there are numerous available therapies in the market for the treatment of
the neuropsychiatric diseases we are targeting, each of these therapies has
significant limitations in addressing the needs of patients. We have pursued the
development of our product candidates based on our deep knowledge of the
pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, the pharmacology of our portfolio
of compounds and the limitations of current therapies. We believe our product
candidates each represent a differentiated treatment option that could overcome
the limitations of current therapies and address the unmet needs of patients and
their families.

of Asia, pursuant to license agreements with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma
Corporation. We further expanded our product candidate portfolio in February
2014 by acquiring the shares of Mind-NRG SA, or Mind-NRG, which has exclusive
rights to develop and commercialize MIN-301, or the Mind-NRG Acquisition. In
addition, in February 2014, we entered into a co-development and license
agreement with Janssen for European Union development and commercialization
rights to MIN-202, which is subject to the completion of this offering.

CEO,John S. Patton
Company Description,"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of inhaled insulin
products for the treatment of diabetes. Our lead product candidate, Dance 501,
is a drug/device combination product designed to deliver a high purity liquid
insulin formulation through a small handheld electronic> inhaler to reduce or
eliminate the need for daily injections. We recently completed a Phase 2,
randomized, active-controlled clinical trial investigating three dose levels of
inhaled insulin in adult patients with type 2 diabetes. We plan to initiate a
single global Phase 3 clinical trial in early 2015 and pursue regulatory
approvals in the European Union, United States and China, three markets with
high and growing incidence of type 2 diabetes.

Dance 501 consists of a preservative-free, high purity liquid formulation of
recombinant human insulin stored in a sterile dispenser and a small handheld
electronic inhaler. The electronic inhaler utilizes a vibrating mesh technology,
designed to produce consistently sized particles of liquid insulin in the form
of a smooth mist, allowing the efficient and consistent delivery of insulin into
the lungs while a patient breathes comfortably. Key technology components of our
dispenser and electronic inhaler, particularly the sterile pump and vibrating
mesh aerosol generator, are currently utilized by third parties in other United
States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or European Medicines Agency, or
EMA, approved products for indications other than diabetes, and are already
manufactured in commercial quantities. We believe the potential benefits of
Dance 501, as well as demonstrated patient preference for inhaled insulin, will
allow patients to more readily comply with recent treatment guidelines, which
generally recommend earlier use of insulin for type 2 diabetes.

We have completed a Phase 1/2 randomized, active-controlled clinical trial of
Dance 501 in 12 adult type 1 diabetes patients and a Phase 2, randomized,
active-controlled clinical trial investigating three dose levels in 23 adult
patients with type 2 diabetes. In each of these studies, Dance 501 delivered
consistent, therapeutic doses of insulin and was not associated with any
significant adverse events. The Phase 2 trial was conducted under both EMA and
FDA investigational applications. We received key pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamics response data from our Phase 2 trial in March 2014. We plan to
initiate a global Phase 3 clinical trial in early 2015 and to pursue regulatory
approvals, initially for type 2 diabetes in adults, in the European Union,
United States and China. The EMA has indicated that a single global, one-year,
Phase 3 trial involving 750 adult patients may be adequate to support approval
in the European Union.

Inhaled insulin has been studied in over 10,000 patients across more than 100
clinical trials, demonstrating safety and efficacy. We believe the historical
published safety and efficacy data available for previously developed inhaled
insulin products, our high purity liquid insulin formulation, and the commercial
validation of our key technology components will allow us to pursue clinical
development and regulatory approvals for Dance 501 in an efficient and cost
effective manner. In addition, we utilize established manufacturing processes to
produce and package our liquid formulation, which we expect will allow us to
price Dance 501 competitively compared to leading injection products. We are
leveraging regulatory filings and published data from these third-party trials,
as well as the prior experience of our management team with inhaled insulin, in
our development of Dance 501.

Our management team’s experience developing inhaled insulin, along with direct
input from patients and clinicians, enabled us to design a product that we
believe will provide an attractive alternative to insulin injections. John S.
Patton, Ph.D., our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and founder, played a key
role in the development of the first inhaled insulin product, Exubera, which was
approved by both the FDA and EMA. Dr. Patton has over 20 years of experience
leading the development of inhaled insulin and was the co-founder of Nektar
Therapeutics (formerly known as Inhale Therapeutic Systems, Inc.), which
developed Exubera in collaboration with Pfizer Inc.

Company Description,"We are a leading provider of international seaborne transportation services for
crude oil and petroleum products. As of March 31, 2014, we owned and operated a
fleet of 12 modern Suezmax tankers with an aggregate carrying capacity of
1,877,000 DWTs. Our vessels were built at leading shipyards and> include three
groups of sister ships, which we believe results in improved scheduling
flexibility and higher operating efficiency through economies of scale for these
ten ships. We believe that our fleet's average age of approximately four years,
which is younger than the average age of approximately nine years for the world
crude tanker fleet, makes our fleet attractive to our customers and also reduces
operating costs and increases our fleet's reliability, which improves
utilization.

The details for each of our tankers are as follows:

    Shell's option for a second year; initial and option charter years at fixed
    daily rates of $15,566 and $18,066, respectively.

We believe we are well positioned to benefit from a continuing recovery in the
global crude tanker market. Increasing global demand for crude oil, driven by
strengthening global economic activity and industrial production, in addition to
longer voyage distances due to additional imports into Asia, is resulting in
increased seaborne trade volumes. This, combined with a significant contraction
in overall vessel supply growth, is driving an increase in day rates and vessel
prices for crude tankers. We believe that to the extent these trends continue,
we are well positioned to take advantage of these improving crude tanker market
fundamentals as our vessel employment strategy provides us with the ability to
benefit from upswings in tanker market earnings.

We utilize a balanced employment strategy for our fleet which provides us with
the ability to benefit from upswings in tanker spot market earnings through
(a) strategic proprietary spot trading arrangements, (b) pool participations and
(c) market-index linked time charters, as well as a stable base of contracted
cash flows from fixed-rate time charters. We currently employ eight of our 12
vessels with Shell in a combination of strategic proprietary spot trading
arrangements, market-index linked time charters and fixed-rate time charters.
Three of our 12 vessels currently operate in a pool with Stena Sonangol and one
vessel is employed in a strategic proprietary spot trading arrangement with Core
Petroleum. We believe that operating vessels through strategic proprietary spot
trading arrangements, pools and market-index linked time charters, relative to
operating directly in the spot market, is advantageous because these vessels
generally enjoy more stable earnings and higher utilization in what has been and
may continue to be a volatile crude tanker market, while still being able to
benefit from increases in earnings due to tanker market upswings. As a result of
our balanced employment strategy, our vessels on average earned approximately
24% and 11% above the spot market rate for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012, respectively. Our vessels are also qualified to perform voyages for other
major oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron, and BP. While future volatility in

the crude tanker market may impact our business, we believe that our charter
arrangements with blue-chip customers position us to benefit from a recovery in
the global crude tanker market while providing us with a stable base of cash
flows.

Since commencing operations in early 2010, we have accomplished significant
growth through the effective utilization of a scalable and cost-effective
operating structure that includes the use of key outsourced service providers
under management agreements. Accordingly, we have enlisted Principal Management
to act as our Manager. Principal Management has a strong track record of
successfully satisfying the operational, safety, environmental and technical
vetting criteria of some of the world's most selective major international oil
companies, including, among others, Shell, Exxon, Chevron, BP, PetroChina and
Unipec. The Technical Managers of our fleet are Northern Marine and Bernhard
Schulte, which are both recognized and well-respected managers in the
international shipping industry. We believe this structure will continue to
allow us to grow efficiently while maintaining cost-effective operations.

Our U.S.-based executive management team has extensive experience in the
international shipping industry, with a demonstrated track record in all facets
of the business, including sale and purchase, commercial and technical, finance
and capital markets, insurance and risk management and legal. Guided by our
management team, we have grown our fleet from zero to 12 vessels since 2010,
through successful execution of accretive vessel acquisitions. In addition, our
Manager has a history of forming strategic relationships with key players in the
shipping industry. Having the combined benefits of an experienced executive
management team, a high quality Manager, a strong Sponsor and a conservative
balance sheet we believe provides a strong foundation for future fleet and
earnings growth.

Company Description,"We are a growth-oriented limited partnership formed to own, operate and acquire
liquefied natural gas, or “LNG”, carriers engaged in LNG transportation under
long-term charters, which we define as charters of five full years or more. Our
initial fleet of three LNG carriers, which will have charter> terms expiring in
2018 and 2019, will be contributed to us by GasLog, which will control us
through its ownership of our general partner. GasLog was founded and is
effectively controlled by its chairman, Peter G. Livanos, whose family’s
shipping activities commenced more than 100 years ago.

Upon the closing of this offering, we will own three LNG carriers, built in
2013, with modern tri-fuel diesel electric propulsion technology that operate
under long-term charters with subsidiaries of BG Group. We will also have
options and other rights under which we may acquire additional LNG carriers from
GasLog, as described below. We believe that such options and rights will provide
us with significant built-in growth opportunities and allow us to diversify our
fleet specification potentially to include steam-powered ships. We may also
acquire vessels from shipyards or other owners. We intend to operate our vessels
under long-term charters with predictable cash flows and to grow our position in
the LNG market through further acquisitions of LNG carriers from GasLog and
third parties. We believe we can grow our distributions per unit organically by
providing reliable customer service to our charterers and leveraging GasLog’s
relationships, expertise and reputation. We intend to make further acquisitions
of LNG carriers from GasLog and third parties to grow our fleet. However, we
cannot assure you that we will make any particular acquisition or that as a
consequence we will successfully grow the amount of our per unit distributions.
Among other things, our ability to acquire additional LNG carriers will be
dependent upon our ability to raise additional equity and debt financing.

GasLog is, we believe, a leading independent international owner, operator and
manager of LNG carriers and provides support to international energy companies
as part of their LNG logistics chain. On April 4, 2012, GasLog completed its
initial public offering, and its common shares began trading on the New York
Stock Exchange on March 30, 2012, under the symbol “GLOG”. At the time of its
initial public offering, GasLog’s owned fleet consisted of ten LNG carriers,
including eight newbuildings on order. Since its initial public offering, GasLog
has increased by approximately 83% the total carrying capacity of vessels in its
fleet, which includes vessels on the water, newbuildings on order and secondhand
vessels under contract to be purchased. This increase includes two LNG
newbuilding orders announced in February 2013 and two LNG newbuilding orders
announced in August 2013, all of which are expected to be delivered in 2016, the
acquisition of one 2010 built LNG carrier announced in September 2013, and the
three secondhand steam-powered ships that are under contract to be purchased
from BG Group. Each of the four newbuildings is under a long-term charter, which
will commence upon delivery. Since January 1, 2013, GasLog has taken delivery of
five LNG carriers, acquired one on-the-water vessel, entered into contracts to
purchase three secondhand vessels and secured six additional LNG newbuilding
options. GasLog currently has a fully-owned eighteen-ship fleet, including
eleven ships on the water (two ships delivered in 2010, five ships delivered in
2013, one on-the-water ship acquired in 2013, and the three secondhand vessels
being acquired from BG Group), and seven LNG carriers on order from Samsung.

Company Description,"We invented a purpose-built mobile IT platform for enterprises to secure and
manage mobile applications, content and devices while providing their employees
with device choice, privacy and a native user experience. Customers use our
platform as the technology foundation on their journey to become> “Mobile First”
organizations, embracing mobility as a primary computing platform for their
employees. Mobile First organizations transform their businesses by giving their
employees secure access to critical business applications and content on devices
employees want with a native user experience they love. Our platform is
extensible and fosters a growing ecosystem of application developers and
technology partners who augment the functionality and add value to our platform,
creating positive network effects for our customers, our ecosystem and our
company.

The adoption of mobile technology is a disruption of historic proportions and
has outpaced earlier transitions such as mainframe to PCs and client/server to
the Internet. IT departments are often challenged to provide users the benefits
of mobility, while simultaneously satisfying enterprise requirements. Users want
to access business applications, or apps, and corporate content on their
favorite smartphone and tablet with the same ease of use they experience on
those devices in their personal lives. Users also expect their privacy to be
preserved when using their personal devices at work. As a result, IT must
satisfy new requirements, including enforcing mobile security, defining mobile
management and compliance policies, supporting multiple, rapidly evolving mobile
operating systems, enabling both corporate-owned and user-owned devices and
mobilizing enterprise applications and content, all while ensuring compatibility
with existing IT infrastructure.

Our mobile IT platform addresses the requirements of the mobile era by allowing
enterprises to protect corporate data, deliver apps and content, and give users
choice of popular mobile devices. Our architecture promotes employee
productivity, separates personal data from corporate data, provides a native
user experience and gives IT the ability to define security and management
policies independent of the device. We enable corporate-owned, bring your own
device (BYOD) and mixed device ownership environments.

Our business model is based on winning new customers, expanding sales within
existing customers, upselling new products and renewing subscriptions and
software support agreements. We win customers using a sales force that works
closely with our channel partners, including resellers, service providers and
system integrators. We have experienced rapid growth in our customer base,
having sold our platform to over 6,000 customers since 2009. Our strategy is
based on our existing customers expanding the number of mobile device licenses
or subscriptions purchased to facilitate their Mobile First journey. The group
of our customers that first bought our products in 2010 subsequently purchased
through December 31, 2013 over five times the initial number of mobile device
licenses. We enhance the value of our platform by introducing additional
products and upselling these additional products to our customers. For example,
in late 2012, we extended our platform with new application container and
content products, including Docs@Work and AppConnect. Our global Customer
Success organization creates highly satisfied customers, leading to additional
sales and renewals of subscription and software agreements. In 2013, we
generated nearly half of our gross billings from recurring sources. Our renewal
rate, determined on a device basis, was greater than 90% for software support
agreements and subscription licenses for 2013.

We offer our customers the flexibility to use our software as a cloud service or
to deploy it on-premise. They can also choose from various pricing options
including subscription and perpetual licensing. We target customers of all sizes
across a broad range of industries including financial services, government,
healthcare, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, technology and
telecommunications. As of December 31, 2013, we have sold our solutions to over
6,000 customers worldwide including over 350 of the Global 2000. No customer
accounted for more than 5% of our total revenue in 2013.

drill bit remanufacturing facility, as well as a state-of-the-art, high-tech
drill tool machining facility. We manufacture our drill string enhancement
tools, including the patent pending “Drill N Ream” well bore enhancement tool,
and conduct our new product research and development from this facility. We
believe that we continue to set the trend in oil and gas drill bit and drill
string tool technology and design.

Our co-founder, Troy Meier, developed the first commercially-viable process to
remanufacture PDC drill bits after a successful 13-year career with a
predecessor of our largest client, Baker Hughes, the world’s fifth largest
oilfield services company. For the past 18 years, we have serviced the Rocky
Mountain, California and Alaska regions exclusively for Baker Hughes’s
substantial oil field operations. We continuously work with our customers to
develop new products and enhancements, improve efficiency and safety, and solve
complex drilling tool problems. We employ a senior work force with special
training and extensive experience related to drill bit remanufacturing and
tooling manufacture. They produce our products and services using a suite of
highly technical, purpose-built equipment, much of which we design and
manufacture for our proprietary use. Most of our manufacturing equipment and
products use advanced, patent-pending technologies that enable us to increase
efficiency, enhance drill bit integrity, and improve safety.

Recently, challenging new horizontal oil and gas well designs and construction
have substantially increased the technical demands on drill bit and drill string
components. To respond to this horizontal drilling challenge, we collaborated
with Hard Rock Solutions, Inc. (“HRSI”). HRSI designed the Drill N Ream well
bore conditioning tool in 2011 (“Drill N Ream”). The Drill N Ream tool is a
dual-section reaming tool which is located behind the bottom hole assembly
(“BHA”) of the drill string to smooth and slightly enlarge the well bore in the
curved and horizontal sections of horizontal wells, in both oil and water based
mud. The Drill N Ream tool is available in multiple sizes and can be custom
manufactured to fit any hole size. The Drill N Ream tool allows the drill string
to move through a conditioned well bore left by the drill bit with less friction
and material stress, extending the horizontal distance that can be drilled
during a run and making tripping (removal of the drill string) and the running
of casing in the completed well much easier. Each time a drilling operator has
to retract a drill string and replace a bit or other drill string component, it
costs the operator substantial time and money, so we believe anything that
allows each run to extend further is of great value to our customers. As a
result, the Drill N Ream tool is now in use in over 850 well drilling
operations, which we believe indicates significant initial industry acceptance
in a fairly short period of time. We are also developing a suite of other
horizontal drill string tools, each of which addresses a different technical
challenge presented by today’s horizontal drilling designs.

Under our existing agreement with HRSI, we produce the Drill N Ream tools and
HRSI markets them to well operators on a rental basis. This arrangement allows
the well operator to switch out Drill N Ream tools when theirs becomes dull, and
HRSI then returns the dull tools to us for refurbishing. We now have the
opportunity to purchase HRSI’s interest in the Drill N Ream tool rental
business, including the Drill N Ream inventory, rental arrangements, customer
lists, contract employees, facilities and its owner’s 50% interest in the
patents pending relating to the Drill N Ream. Before closing our acquisition,
HRSI will move those assets into its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hard Rock
Solutions, LLC (“Hard Rock”). We intend to use a portion of the offering 
proceeds to complete our purchase of Hard Rock, at which time we will operate
Hard Rock as our wholly-owned subsidiary.

We believe that we differentiate ourselves from our competitors on the basis of
the quality and reliability of our products and services, our proprietary
technology, and our ability to rapidly respond with products that meet the most
demanding and changing needs of our customers.

Company Description,"We are a leading online leisure travel company in China. We offer a large
selection of packaged tours, including organized tours and self-guided tours, as
well as travel-related services for leisure travelers. We ranked first in
China’s online organized tours market as measured by transaction value> in 2013,
according to iResearch, a third-party research firm. We believe we are well
positioned to benefit from the significant growth potential of China’s online
leisure travel market, which is expected to grow at a compound annual growth
rate, or CAGR, of 35.6% from 2013 to 2016 as measured by transaction value,
according to iResearch.

We started offering packaged tours online in 2007, and are among the earliest
Chinese companies that focus on the online leisure travel market. As an early
mover in China’s online leisure travel market, we have sold over three million
packaged tours since our inception. We offer packaged tours sourced from over
3,000 travel suppliers, covering over 70 countries as well as all popular
tourist attractions in China. Our product portfolio consists of over 100,000
stock-keeping units, or SKUs, of organized tours, over 100,000 SKUs of
self-guided tours, and tickets for over 1,000 domestic and overseas tourist
attractions. Our core strength is in overseas leisure travel products and
services, which contributed over 70% of our gross bookings in 2013.

We have established “Tuniu” as a trusted and widely recognized brand in leisure
travel in China, powered by a compelling customer experience. Our online
platform, which comprises our tuniu.com website and mobile platform, provides
comprehensive product and travel information through user-friendly interfaces to

To cultivate customer loyalty and ensure customer satisfaction, we complement
our online platform with an extensive nationwide service network, including our
centralized call center in Nanjing and 15 regional service centers across China.
We have a team of over 400 well-trained tour advisors to closely assist
customers through their booking process. We believe that our high-quality
customer service has contributed to the continuous growth in our customer base.
The total number of trips sold by us grew from approximately 850,000 in 2012 to
approximately 1,280,000 in 2013.

Our recognized brand in leisure travel and growing customer base enable us to
source a broad range of products from high-quality travel suppliers at
competitive prices. We rigorously select our travel suppliers to ensure quality
and reliability. We have developed our proprietary supply chain management 
system—N-booking system—to streamline our interactions with travel suppliers, 
allowing them to receive booking information real-time, more efficiently manage
travel products and better understand customer preferences. 

We have achieved significant growth in recent years. Our net revenues increased
from RMB765.5 million in 2011 to RMB1,112.9 million in 2012 and further to
RMB1,949.7 million (US$322.1 million) in 2013, representing a CAGR of 59.6%. We
had a net loss of RMB91.9 million, RMB107.2 million and RMB79.6 million (US$13.2
million) in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. We generally collect payments
from our customers upon contract confirmation before we pay our travel
suppliers, which allows us to generate positive cash flow from operations. Our
net cash provided by operating activities was RMB36.3 million, RMB14.7 million
and RMB116.7 million (US$19.3 million) in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability depends on our ability to
effectively reduce our costs and expenses as a percentage of our net revenues.
Our cost of revenues as a percentage of our net revenues decreased from 96.9% in
2011 to 96.5% in 2012 and further to 93.8% in 2013. Cost to suppliers of our
organized tours, which were attributed solely to revenues from organized tours,
accounted for 92.1%, 93.8% and 92.4% of our revenues from organized tours in
2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Our operating expenses as a percentage of our
net revenues decreased from 16.2% in 2011 to 13.7% in 2012 and further to 11.1%
in 2013. Such decreases were primarily attributable to the improved operational
efficiency and decrease of our average procurement costs for travel products.
However, our past results of operations should not be taken as indicative of our
future performance. We plan to increase our sales and marketing efforts,
including advertising campaigns, to further increase our market share. We also
expect our share-based compensation to increase. As a result, we expect our
operating expenses to increase in absolute amount. If we fail to effectively
reduce our costs and expenses as a percentage of our net revenues, we may not be
able to achieve and maintain profitability.

development, and acquisition of natural gas, NGL and oil properties with a
majority of our activity in the Terryville Complex of North Louisiana, where we
are targeting overpressured, liquids-rich natural gas> opportunities in multiple
zones in the Cotton Valley formation. Our total leasehold position is 347,458
gross (205,818 net) acres, of which 60,041 gross (51,522 net) acres are in what
we believe to be the core of the Terryville Complex. We are focused on creating
shareholder value primarily through the development of our sizeable horizontal
inventory. As of December 31, 2013, we had 1,297 gross (892 net) identified
horizontal drilling locations, of which over 1,146 gross (796 net) identified
horizontal drilling locations are located in the Terryville Complex. These total
net identified horizontal drilling locations represent an inventory of over 26
years based on our expected 2014 drilling program. We believe our inventory to
be repeatable and capable of generating high returns based on the extensive
production history in the area, the results of our horizontal wells drilled to
date, and the consistent reservoir quality across multiple target formations.

As of December 31, 2013, we had estimated proved, probable and possible reserves
of approximately 1,126 Bcfe, 800 Bcfe and 1,034 Bcfe, respectively. As of such
date, we operated 98% of our proved reserves, 71% of which were natural gas. For
the three months ended December 31, 2013, 45% of our pro forma MRD Segment
revenues were attributable to natural gas production, 28% to NGLs and 27% to
oil. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we generated pro forma MRD Segment
Adjusted EBITDA of $173 million and pro forma net income of $    million, and
made pro forma total capital expenditures of $204 million, including $70 million
for wells coming online in 2014. 

Our average net daily production for the three months ended December 31, 2013
was 137 MMcfe/d (approximately 70% natural gas, 22% NGLs and 8% oil) and our
reserve life was 23 years. As of December 31, 2013, we produced from 95
horizontal wells and 800 vertical wells. The Terryville Complex represented 83%
of our total net production for the three months ended December 31, 2013. Our
estimated average net daily production for the period from February 1 through
February 28, 2014 was 172 MMcfe/d, of which 69% was from natural gas. Our
estimated average net daily production from our properties in the Terryville
Complex for the same period was 150 MMcfe/d, or 87% of our total production. In
the Terryville Complex, we completed and brought online two additional
horizontal wells during the first quarter of 2014, bringing our total number of
producing horizontal wells to 23 in our primary formations. The 30-day initial
production rates of our two most recent wells averaged 15.9 MMcfe/d, which
compares to an average 30-day initial production rate of 15.1 MMcfe/d for all of
our Terryville Complex horizontal wells drilled to date.

Company Description,"Our mission is to transform the car-buying experience for consumers and the
way that dealers attract customers and sell cars. We have established an
intelligent, data-driven online platform operating on a common technology
infrastructure, powered by proprietary data and analytics. We operate> our
company-branded platform on our TrueCar.com website. In addition, we customize
and operate our platform for affinity group marketing partners, such as USAA and
Consumer Reports, financial institutions, and other large enterprises such as
Boeing and Verizon. We enable users to obtain market-based pricing data on new
and used cars, and to connect with our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers.

We benefit consumers by providing information related to what others have
paid for a make and model of car in their area and, where available, estimated
prices for that make and model of car, which we refer to as upfront pricing
information, from our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. This upfront pricing
information generally includes guaranteed savings off MSRP which the consumer
may then take to the dealer in the form of a Guaranteed Savings Certificate and
apply toward the purchase of the specified make and model of car. We benefit our
network of TrueCar Certified Dealers by enabling them to attract these informed,
in-market consumers in a cost-effective, accountable manner, which we believe
helps them to sell more cars.

We are currently focused primarily on new car transactions. In the future,
we intend to introduce additional products and services designed to improve the
car-buying and car-ownership experience. For example, we are developing
TrueTrade to provide users with an estimated daily market value for their
existing cars and a guaranteed trade-in price. In addition, we are developing
TrueLoan and TrueLease to provide users with a more convenient way to finance
their cars at TrueCar Certified Dealers. We are also in the process of launching
a number of new services for our dealers designed to enable them to make better
informed inventory management and pricing decisions and to close transactions
more efficiently.

Our network of over 7,000 TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new 
car franchises, representing all major makes of cars, as well as independent
dealers. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. We estimate that users of our platform purchasing cars from TrueCar
Certified Dealers accounted for approximately 2.0% of all new car sales in the
United States in 2013. Since our founding in 2005, TrueCar users have purchased
over 1.1 million cars from TrueCar Certified Dealers, including nearly 400,000
during 2013.

CEO,Michael Grey
Company Description,"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of novel products for rare cholestatic liver diseases and
serious metabolic disorders, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH,
where there is a high unmet medical need. We are developing two> clinical-stage
product candidates, LUM001 and LUM002, that inhibit the apical sodium-dependent
bile acid transporter, or ASBT, which is primarily responsible for recycling
bile acids from the intestine to the liver. Our product candidates have the
potential to treat orphan and more prevalent liver diseases for which there
currently are limited therapeutic options. We have exclusive worldwide rights to
both of our product candidates. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that
blocking bile acid transport and reducing bile acid reabsorption with ASBT
inhibitors, such as LUM001 and LUM002, has the potential to slow disease
progression, improve liver function and enhance the quality of life for patients
suffering from cholestatic liver diseases and NASH.

Bile acids facilitate the absorption of dietary cholesterol, fat and fat-soluble
vitamins and are increasingly being recognized as signaling molecules that
regulate metabolic processes. Bile acids are synthesized in the liver and stored
in the gall bladder. They are released into the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract,
typically in response to the ingestion of food. ASBT is present in the distal,
or lower, portion of the small intestine where it mediates the uptake of bile
acids across the intestinal cell membrane. ASBT, together with other
transporters and proteins, recycles bile acids from the GI tract back to the
liver via the portal vein. When bile and cholesterol equilibrium, or
homeostasis, is disrupted, bile acids can accumulate in the liver and are
associated with significant liver damage and pruritus, or itching. Inhibiting
ASBT results in more bile acids being excreted in the feces and reduced bile
acids returning to the liver. Bile acids are also potent signaling agents which
can bind to specific receptors in the colon and stimulate the release of
proteins involved in metabolic control. ASBT inhibition has been shown to reduce
cholesterol levels and improve metabolic parameters, including insulin
resistance and blood glucose levels, and could therefore be effective in
addressing NASH.

Our lead product candidate, LUM001, is a novel, once-daily, orally-administered,
potent and selective ASBT inhibitor, or ASBTi, which reduces bile acid
intestinal absorption leading to an increase in bile acid excretion and lower
levels of bile acids in the liver and systemic circulation. LUM001 is currently
in Phase 2 clinical development in children for the treatment of orphan
cholestatic liver diseases including Alagille syndrome, or ALGS, and progressive
familial intrahepatic cholestasis, or PFIC. Based on consultation with
regulatory authorities, we expect to file for regulatory approval for LUM001 in
ALGS and PFIC utilizing the results from our planned and ongoing pediatric Phase
2 trials. LUM001 is also in Phase 2 clinical development in adults for the
treatment of primary biliary cirrhosis, or PBC, and primary sclerosing
cholangitis, or PSC. Pending successful completion of our Phase 2 clinical
trials and input from regulatory authorities, we plan to initiate a Phase 3
development program in these indications to support regulatory approval. We have
developed a proprietary liquid formulation of LUM001 for children and a tablet
formulation of LUM001 for adults.

Cholestatic liver diseases, including ALGS, PFIC, PBC and PSC, are characterized
by elevated bile acids and pruritus, which is generally the most debilitating
symptom afflicting children and adults with these diseases. Surgical
intervention, which lowers bile acid levels, has been shown to relieve pruritus
symptoms and slow disease progression in these patients, but is associated with
significant complications. By reducing serum bile acids, LUM001 may offer a
novel therapeutic approach to alleviate the pruritus and progressive liver
damage associated with cholestatic liver diseases.

LUM001 was designed to be minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation,
thereby minimizing potential safety concerns. It has been extensively studied
through administration to more than 1,400 human subjects in 12 completed
clinical trials evaluating the product candidate as a treatment for elevated
cholesterol levels. Our product candidate demonstrated a favorable safety
profile and an ability to reduce serum bile acid levels in clinical trials to
date. We are currently conducting or expect to initiate seven Phase 2 clinical
trials of LUM001 in North America and Europe. We expect to obtain data from
several of these trials over the course of the next year, beginning with Phase 2
results in ALGS by the second half of 2014, followed by Phase 2 results in PFIC 
and PBC by late 2014 or early 2015. LUM001 has been granted orphan drug 
designation for ALGS, PFIC, PBC and PSC in the United States and the European
Union, providing the opportunity to receive 7 years of market exclusivity in the
United States and 10 years of market exclusivity in the European Union, which
can be extended to 12 years in the European Union if trials are conducted in
accordance with an agreed-upon pediatric investigational plan.

There are no approved therapies for the treatment of patients with ALGS, PFIC or
PSC in the United States. Cholestyramine (Questran®) is only modestly effective
at lowering bile acid levels and slowing progressive liver disease because
patients generally cannot tolerate a high enough dosage to realize the full
therapeutic benefit. Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol), or UDCA, is approved for
the treatment of PBC, but only 20-30% of patients with PBC fully respond to
treatment with UDCA, and the rest eventually develop cirrhosis and liver
failure. In children with ALGS and PFIC, in particular, invasive partial
external biliary diversion surgery, or PEBD surgery, a procedure in which bile
acids are diverted outside the body into an external bag through a hole in the
abdomen, is often used to lower circulating bile acid concentrations. Such
surgical procedures are associated with significant complications. We believe
that there is a significant unmet medical need for a safe, effective and
non-invasive treatment alternative for patients with cholestatic liver disease.

Based on published industry data, we estimate the prevalence of these orphan
cholestatic liver diseases in the table below, as well as the initial
addressable market for LUM001, which consists of patients with moderate to
severe pruritus who have not received PEBD surgery or a liver transplant:

Our second product candidate, LUM002, is a novel, once-daily, 
orally-administered, highly potent and selective ASBT inhibitor in development
for the treatment of NASH, a condition characterized by fat deposits in the
liver, leading to inflammation and significant fibrosis. While the underlying
cause of liver injury in NASH is not known, it is strongly associated with
obesity, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides and other metabolic
disorders. By blocking bile acid reabsorption, we expect LUM002 to reduce
hepatic cholesterol levels and increase colonic bile acid concentrations.
Elevated colonic bile acids signal through receptors on cells in the distal
portion of the large intestine. This signaling stimulates the secretion of
proteins that regulate insulin release from the pancreas and glucose metabolism.
We believe that therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating insulin resistance
and normalizing lipoprotein metabolism have significant potential to benefit
patients with NASH. We have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy
volunteers and metabolic disease patients and plan to initiate a Phase 2
clinical trial in NASH patients in the second half of 2014.

NASH represents a substantial unmet medical need. According to the National
Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, 2-5% of Americans, or 6 million to
16 million individuals, suffer from this disease, of which an estimated 600,000
have been identified as having severe liver disease, which we view as the
initial addressable market for LUM002. In Western countries as a whole, industry
sources estimate that NASH affects 2-3% of the general population, equating to
an additional 10 million to 15 million individuals in Europe. NASH is becoming
more common, largely believed to be related to the widespread increase in
obesity. From 1980 to 2010, the rate of obesity in the United States alone has
more than doubled in adults and more than tripled in children and is expected to
increase by an additional 33% over the next two decades. Globally, the rate of
obesity has also nearly doubled since 1980 and is expected to double again by
2030 if nothing is done to reverse the epidemic. NASH is one of the main causes 
of liver cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease, and is the 
fastest growing cause of liver transplantation in the United States. Despite the
rapidly increasing incidence of NASH, there are no therapies currently approved 
for the treatment of this common liver disorder.

Based on the favorable clinical profiles of LUM001 and LUM002, we believe we are
well positioned to significantly change the treatment paradigm for these orphan
cholestatic liver diseases as well as NASH. Each of these represents a highly
attractive commercial opportunity. We intend to establish commercialization and
marketing capabilities in North America for LUM001 and pursue strategic
partnerships in other territories. We intend to seek strategic partnerships to
accelerate the broader clinical development and commercialization of LUM002 in
NASH and other metabolic diseases.

CEO,Sundeep Malhotra
Company Description,"Our mission is to transform the way consumers in India shop, leveraging 
technology to provide them with a best in class shopping experience across a 
wide range of products, delivered to their doorstep. 

We operate a leading digital commerce platform in India, with a combined reach
of over 250> million consumers, accessed through our integrated television,
Internet and mobile device channels. We provide Indian consumers with a high
quality and integrated shopping experience that combines value, fun,
entertainment and simplicity, which we believe to be superior to what is
commonly available to them. We are focused on the Indian retail market, which
remains highly fragmented and is dominated by small stores with limited
availability and selection of high-quality goods. Since the launch of our
service in 2008, we have built an end-to-end digital commerce platform providing
Indian consumers access to over 1,000 brands, supported by our pan-India
delivery reach and dedicated 24/7 multi-lingual customer service. Using our
platform, international and domestic brands are able to efficiently and
effectively demonstrate, market and sell existing as well as new products to
consumers across India. Our position as the largest pan-India television
shopping channel (based on publicly available financial information) has enabled
us to establish ourselves as a trusted brand, with over 8.9 million consumers
who have placed orders with us since our launch.

To reach and serve the broadest possible customer base, we have developed a
consumer centric platform that combines our television channel with the
discovery, research and comparison tools of our Internet and mobile channels. We
enable consumers to contact us using multiple languages and dialects spoken
across India, enabling us to serve a wide range of consumers. As of December 31,
2013, our television channel, which is carried on pay television systems,
reached approximately 69.0 million households across India, while our Internet
channel had approximately 9.4 million unique visitors during that month,
according to Google Analytics. Our scale and distribution strategy make us an
important relationship for the distributors and manufacturers that offer and
sell products through our digital commerce platform, whom we refer to as our
Sourcing Partners, providing us with the ability to showcase a broad range of
products across multiple categories at competitive prices. We have developed a
technology-enabled logistics network that allows our Sourcing Partners to
deliver products to our customers’ doorstep in over 3,000 towns and cities
across India. We believe that our integrated platform provides consumers across
India with a differentiated and user-friendly experience, service and value.

India has witnessed substantial economic growth over the past decade, with real
gross domestic product growing by 7.3% on an annual compounded rate during the
period, according to The Economist Intelligence Unit, or the EIU. This growth
has in turn led to the emergence of a large middle class across the country,
estimated to encompass approximately 250 million people by 2015 according to a
2007 report of the McKinsey Global Institute. We believe that these consumers,
influenced by mass media and becoming increasingly affluent, are seeking to
enjoy a modern, uniquely Indian lifestyle which includes fun, easy and
accessible shopping as an integral part of everyday life. However, when these
consumers shop, they are often frustrated by the gap between the high-quality
shopping experience they seek, typically portrayed on popular mass media, and
their local, often poor, retail experience.

In addition, the Indian market has unique business dynamics and infrastructure
challenges that require a technological and commercial retail solution that is
different from that found in other parts of the world. India suffers from a lack
of adequate logistics infrastructure which, coupled with its vast geographical
spread, makes delivery of products to consumers across various towns and cities
challenging. Creation of reliable delivery mechanisms requires sizeable
investments in technology, systems and logistics infrastructure. Because of the
relative lack of large organized retail vendors across the country,
infrastructure constraints, and rising costs for physical retail space that
currently characterize the local retail market, digital commerce has become an
important component for manufacturers and distributors who are seeking to reach
and sell their products to Indian consumers on a national basis. Credit card
penetration in India continues to be low, and consumers in India are generally
reluctant to make payments electronically. Hence, most of the transactions
executed through our platform are made on a cash on delivery, or COD, basis as
consumers are more comfortable with cash as a mode of payment. In a COD
transaction, the consumer makes payment in cash upon receipt of the product. In
India, television is benefiting from substantial growth and is the most
pervasive and effective digital medium, with a pay television viewer base of
over 584 million in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. In addition,
India’s Internet use, while still at an early stage of development, had 176
million users as of 2013, according to Euromonitor International. We believe
that our solution enables us to address the needs and consumption aspirations of
the large and growing middle class in India, while providing leading brands with
an effective channel to reach these consumers.

CEO,Joseph A. Chlapaty
Company Description,"We are the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated
pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior
drainage solutions for use in the construction and infrastructure marketplace.
Our innovative products are used across a broad range of end> markets and
applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and
infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of
these end markets by leveraging our national sales and distribution platform,
our overall product breadth and scale and our manufacturing excellence. In North
America, our national footprint combined with our strong local presence and
broad product offering makes us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented
sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in
the United States represent approximately $10.1 billion of annual revenue
opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic
pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth
opportunity. For the nine months ended December 31, 2013, we generated net sales
of $887.8 million, net income of $24.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $130.6
million.

Our products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier
to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials.
Following our entrance into the non-residential construction market with the
introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, our pipe
has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete,
corrugated steel and polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, across an ever expanding range
of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above
market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive
conversion to our products from traditional products as contractors, civil
design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior
physical attributes and compelling value proposition of our thermoplastic
products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for our products will
benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.

Our broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or HDPE)
pipe, polypropylene (or PP) pipe and related water management products. Building
on our core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive
ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage
structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We
refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope
of our overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive
growth within our Allied Products and believe there are significant growth
opportunities going forward.

We have an extensive domestic network of 48 manufacturing plants and 19
distribution centers allowing us to effectively serve all major markets in all
50 U.S. states. The effective shipping radius for our pipe products is
approximately 200 miles, thus competition in our industry tends to be on a
regional and local basis with minimal competition from distant markets and
imports. We are the only supplier in our industry with a national footprint,
thereby allowing us to efficiently service those customers that value having one
source of supply throughout their entire distribution network. We believe our
extensive national footprint creates a cost and service advantage versus our
HDPE pipe producing competitors, the largest of which has only 10 domestic HDPE
pipe manufacturing plants. Internationally, we have two manufacturing plants and
three distribution centers in Canada, four manufacturing plants in Mexico, four
manufacturing plants and five distribution centers in South America and one
distribution center in Europe.

We have long-standing distribution relationships with many of the largest
national and independent waterworks distributors, including Ferguson, HD Supply
and WinWholesale, who sell primarily to the storm sewer and sanitary sewer
markets. We also utilize a network of hundreds of small to medium-sized
independent distributors across the United States. We have strong relationships
with major national retailers that carry drainage products, including The Home
Depot, Lowe’s, Ace Hardware, Menards and Do it Best, and also sell to buying
groups and co-ops in the United States that serve the plumbing, hardware,
irrigation and landscaping markets. The combination of our large sales force,
long-standing retail and contractor customer relationships and extensive network
of manufacturing and distribution facilities complements and strengthens our
broad customer and market coverage.

We believe the ADS brand has long been associated with quality products and
market-leading performance. Our trademarked green stripe, which is prominently
displayed on many of our products, serves as clear identification of our
commitment to the customers and markets we serve.

higher performance materials (composites) and we will intend to incorporate them
in product design and development.
 
Through its proprietary use of materials and manufacturing technique, FairWind
Energy is developing power sources drawing from renewable energy supply. We also
use our trade secrets and composite industry know-how to cross-market products
into the oil &amp; gas extraction industry. Providing a reliable power source based
on renewable energies required us to address shortcomings of existing
technologies ranging from availability of supply (i.e., solar power at night) to
quality of componentry available (blades, stanchions, magnets). The
hybridization of power sources (solar and wind) and manufacturing with next
generation composite materials is our solution.

CEO,Santiago Seage
Company Description,"We are a dividend growth-oriented company formed to serve as the primary vehicle
through which Abengoa, S.A. (MCE: ABG SM, ABG.B/P SM /NASDAQ: ABGB), or Abengoa,
will own, manage and acquire renewable energy, conventional power and electric
transmission lines and other contracted revenue-generating> assets, initially
focused on North America (the United States and Mexico) and South America (Peru,
Chile, Uruguay and Brazil), as well as Europe (Spain). In the future, we intend
to expand this presence to selected countries in Africa and the Middle East.

We believe we are well positioned to be a premier company for investors seeking
a total return based on stable and growing dividend income from a diversified
portfolio of low-risk, high-quality assets, and for investors with a key
objective of accretive dividend growth.

We intend to take advantage of favorable trends in the power generation and
electric transmission sectors globally, including energy scarcity and a focus on
the reduction of carbon emissions. To that end, we believe that our cash flow
profile, coupled with our scale, diversity and low-cost business model, will
offer us a lower cost of capital than that of a traditional engineering and
construction company or independent power producer and provide us with a
significant competitive advantage with which to execute our growth strategy.

With this business model, our objective is to pay a consistent and growing cash
dividend to holders of our shares that is sustainable on a long-term basis. We
expect to target a payout ratio of 90% of our cash available for distribution
and will seek to increase such cash dividends over time through organic growth
and as we acquire assets with characteristics similar to those in our current
portfolio. We will focus on high-quality, newly-constructed and long-life
facilities with creditworthy counterparties that we expect will produce stable,
long-term cash flows.

Upon consummation of this offering, we will own eleven assets, comprising 710 MW
of renewable energy generation, 300 MW of conventional power generation and
1,018 miles of electric transmission lines and an exchangeable preferred equity
investment in ACBH. Each of the assets we own has a project-finance agreement in
place. Our project-level debt was approximately $2,895 million as of December
31, 2013. When we refer to these assets as our assets or being owned by us
throughout this prospectus, we mean that they will be transferred to us by
Abengoa and owned by us immediately prior to the consummation of the offering.

We have signed an exclusive agreement with Abengoa, which we refer to as the
ROFO Agreement, which provides us with a right of first offer on any proposed
sale, transfer or other disposition of any of Abengoa’s contracted renewable
energy, conventional power, electric transmission or water assets in operation
and located in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Brazil,
Colombia and the European Union, as well as four assets in selected countries in
Africa and the Middle East. Based on the acquisition opportunities available to
us, which include the Abengoa ROFO Assets as well as any third-party 
acquisitions we pursue, we believe that we will have the opportunity to grow 
our cash available for distribution in a manner that would allow us to further 
increase our cash dividends per share over time.
