## Why does this have stars?

I get lots of spammy messages from recruiters. I now require a "proof of work". In order to for a recruiter to send me 
a message they first must go to this site, click on the `</>` symbol above my name, and mine ~30k Monero hashes before 
they are given my contact info. Folks thought that was cheeky so they gave me some stars.
